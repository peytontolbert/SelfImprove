Ollama-Centric Automated Development System Architecture
1. System Overview
This system is designed as a fully automated end-to-end software development platform, with Ollama AI at its core. Ollama is integrated into every component and decision-making process, acting as the central "brain" of the entire system.
2. Core Components
2.1 Ollama Integration Layer

Serves as the primary interface for all Ollama interactions
Manages a vast library of specialized prompts for different tasks
Handles response parsing, validation, and error recovery

2.2 Task Management System

Uses Ollama to generate task decomposition and prioritization
Ollama-driven orchestration of complex workflows
Dynamic task queue management based on Ollama's decisions

2.3 Version Control System

File-based version control using Git
Ollama generates commit messages, decides on branching strategies
Changelog generation guided by Ollama

2.4 Knowledge Base

PostgreSQL database for storing code snippets, patterns, and metadata
Ollama-driven querying and information retrieval
Continuous knowledge base updates based on Ollama's learning

2.5 Code Analysis and Generation

Ollama performs code analysis using provided code as context
Generates improvement suggestions and refactoring ideas
Produces new code based on high-level descriptions or requirements

2.6 Testing Framework

Ollama generates unit tests, integration tests, and test scenarios
Analyzes test results and suggests improvements
Evolves testing strategies based on project complexity

2.7 Monitoring and Logging

All logs and metrics are processed by Ollama for insights
Ollama generates monitoring rules and alerting thresholds
Continuous system health evaluation by Ollama

2.8 Self-Improvement Mechanism

Ollama analyzes its own performance and suggests improvements
Generates new prompts or refines existing ones
Evolves decision-making strategies based on outcomes

2.9 Multi-Agent Communication

Ollama manages communication between different system components
Resolves conflicts and decides on information flow
Optimizes collaboration strategies among system parts

2.10 Error Handling and Recovery

Ollama analyzes errors and suggests recovery strategies
Generates fallback plans for critical failures
Evolves error prevention strategies over time

2.11 Natural Language Understanding

Ollama processes all user inputs for intent and context
Generates clarifying questions when needed
Improves understanding over time through user interactions

3. System Workflow

User Input Processing (Ollama)
Task Decomposition and Planning (Ollama)
Resource Allocation Decision (Ollama)
Code Analysis/Generation (Ollama)
Testing Strategy Formulation (Ollama)
Test Execution and Analysis (Ollama)
Version Control Actions (Ollama + Git)

4. Prompt Management

Extensive library of prompts for each system function
Prompts are versioned and continuously refined by Ollama
Meta-prompts for generating new prompts or modifying existing ones

5. Error Handling Strategy

Multi-level exception handling, all processed by Ollama
Ollama generates retry strategies with dynamic parameters
Fallback plans for critical components, designed by Ollama

6. Scalability Approach

Ollama decides on resource allocation and scaling strategies
Dynamic load balancing across available resources, guided by Ollama
Ollama suggests architectural changes for better scalability
