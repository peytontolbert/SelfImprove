# Ollama-Centric Automated Development System

## Overview

This project is an ambitious attempt to create a fully automated end-to-end software development system with Ollama AI at its core. The system is designed to handle complex tasks and adapt to new technologies, all driven by AI decision-making.

## Key Features

- Ollama-driven task management and orchestration, ensuring deep integration in decision-making.
- AI-powered code analysis and generation, with Ollama as the primary reviewer.
- Automated testing and enhanced error handling with adaptive strategies guided by Ollama.
- Self-improving architecture using reinforcement learning feedback and Ollama's insights.
- Natural language understanding for user interactions, continuously refined by Ollama.
- Version control with AI-generated commit messages and strategies, reviewed by Ollama.
- Spreadsheet-based logging and tracking for system improvements and metrics, with Ollama's input.
- Continuous feedback loop optimization and adaptive learning strategies driven by Ollama.
- Ethical AI development and alignment considerations, regularly consulted with Ollama.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Git
- Ollama API access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ollama-dev-system.git
   cd ollama-dev-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in `config/system_config.yaml`.

5. Ensure you have access to the Ollama API and update the API endpoint in `config/system_config.yaml`.

## Usage

To start the system:

```
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to interact with the system and initiate automated development tasks.
