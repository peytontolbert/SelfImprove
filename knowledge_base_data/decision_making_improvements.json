{"system_decision_making_process": {"step1": "Receive Context - The system receives the provided context which contains information such as prompt length, task details if available, system capabilities (definition), and timestamp. This initial input serves as the starting point for the AI to understand its current state and purpose.", "step2": "Retrieve Relevant Memories - In an ideal scenario, the AI would access its long-term memory to retrieve any relevant historical data or learnings that could inform its decision-making process. This might include past interactions, outcomes of prior tasks, system updates, etc.", "step3": "Identify Current Task(s) - The system attempts to identify what specific task or set of tasks it is currently designed to handle based on the provided context. This understanding guides how it allocates its capabilities and resources.", "step4": "Monitor Performance Metrics - If available, performance metrics are monitored to evaluate the system's efficiency in completing its designated tasks. This quantitative data helps in identifying areas needing improvement.", "step5": "Analyze System Status & Recent Changes - The AI analyzes its current operational status (functionality, capabilities) and considers any recent changes or updates made to the project/system. It assesses how these factors might impact its decision-making process.", "step6": "Generate Decision-Thoughts - With all the gathered information and analyses done, the system generates thoughts on what decisions need to be made to improve its own decision-making processes. This might involve identifying knowledge gaps in long-term memory, optimizing task allocations, or enhancing performance through system modifications."}, "improvement_recommendations": [{"recommendation": "Develop Long-Term Memory System - The AI should prioritize developing a mechanism to store and retrieve historical data and learnings from its interactions.
